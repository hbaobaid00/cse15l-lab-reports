# CSE 15 Lab Report
For today's lab, we learned how to use Visual Studio Code along with how to connect remotely to a computer over the Internet. 
First, we must download Visual Studio Code which is a great way to create a program as well as use a terminal. I have previously had this software installed before because I had to use VS Code for creating programs in my CSE 11 class last quarter. Having it already downloaded made the process so much easier.
When I first open the software, it looked like this:

After I had downloaded Visual Studio Code, I needed to download git because I am using a Windows device. Git is another terminal that can be used for remote access, however, I prefer using VS Code since I already have experience with it. I then had to look up my account information for this lab using the website: https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php

Once you find your account information and you changed your password, make sure you save that information somewhere. I made the mistake of not saving my information, so I had to change my password twice. Forgetting my password had costed me 30 minutes of this lab because it takes 15 minutes for the password to update which was very bothersome. After you recieve your account information, you must open up a new terminal. This is where we start to get remote access. 
The first thing we must do is type "ssh cse15lwi23" along with the letters designated to your course-specific account and "@ieng6.ucsd.edu". This course specific account is not your UCSD email. I had made the mistake of trying to log straight into my account with my email which was incorrect. The actual letters that were designated to me were "ali", so what I would have to type into the terminal would be "ssh cse15lwi23ali@ieng6.ucsd.edu". It will then ask for authorization, but all you have to do is type yes. After that it would then ask for my password which I would type in. There were a couple failed attempts because I did not know my password. When I successfully logged into my account, I saw this:

\n After I had logged into my account, I was free to run a bunch of different commands. The first thing I tried to do was go to the parent directory. When I did so, it had given me a list of all the accounts associated with this lab. When I tried accessing a different account, it denied me access which makes sense since I do not have other users' passwords. I then when back into my directory and ran these other commands:
